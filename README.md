> I took this photo for my 
> *Seminar in Environmental Philosophy* class,
> which was taught by Dr. David O'Hara. One of
> our assignments was to go to one of the
> campus gardens and make observations
> on a 1x1 meter area of our choice throughout
> the semester. I remember what Dr. O'Hara
> used to say: "do observation with your eyes
> and your hands."
>
> **How did you remove the background?**<br>
> I used a website called
> [remove.bg](https://www.remove.bg/)
> which uses a machine-learning algorithm
> to remove backgrounds automatically.
> At first, I didn't remove the background, but
> I realized that 
> [Augie Gardens website](https://augie-environmental-studies.github.io/gardens/)
> looks better with the background removed because
> this not only makes it easier to read the text
> on the website, but also emphasizes the sunflower and the bee.
